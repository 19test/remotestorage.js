This library is primarily meant for use in unhosted web apps,
but you can also use it with nodejs. The way to do this is
currently in flux, and will change when we tag and publish
the next release, so then this document will also be updated.

Right now, the way to use it is as follows:

* check out remotestorage.js from github, and update to latest master
* npm install
* make all
* node doc/node-example.js
