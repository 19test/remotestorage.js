Setting up unhosted storage for your own user address
=============================

This repository contains everything you need to set up your own unhosted storage node. It assumes you take a freshly formatted debian squeeze server, and set up WordPress, ownCloud and BrowserMail on there. Just follow storage-only-install-debian.md. If you want to help, then please testdrive our DreamHost install instructions: storage-only-install-dreamhost.md. If you can't get it work, please drop by in our [chat room](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=unhosted).
