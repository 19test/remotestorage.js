This repo is the home of our client-side library, which is http://unhost.it/remoteStorage.js (staging)
and http://unhosted.org/remoteStorage.js (production).
To "build", edit ./build.sh to contain the path to your localhost webserver,
in my case i have checked out https://github.com/unhosted/experiments.git next to it, and i'm staging
by copying to ../experiments/domains/unhost.it/remoteStorage.js
If you have questions, go to http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=unhosted and ask. If you don't get
an immediate reply, email support @unhosted.org.


Happy hacking!
