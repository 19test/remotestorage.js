Setting up unhosted storage for your own user address
=============================

This repository contains everything you need to set up your own unhosted storage node. It assumes you take a freshly formatted debian squeeze server, and set up WordPress, ownCloud and BrowserMail on there. I (michielbdejong) recorded what i did to set up the storage part of myfavouritesandwich.org in MyFavouriteSandwich-install-history.txt. If you can't get it work, please drop by in our [chat room](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=unhosted).

Setting up your own apptorrent node
==============================

Apptorrent is still under construction. The first parts of it are in the /node directory of this repository.
