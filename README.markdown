Please log in to #unhosted on irc.freenode.net so we can help you get this working on your server.
======================

This code is published under the AGPL license. It's what you need to build your own unhosted website, which means it consists of two halves:

* a 'hello world' unhosted web app which you can change to turn it into your own unhosted web app.
* an unhosted storage node: any user accounts you create on here automatically become usable as unhosted accounts on other 
people's unhosted websites.

This code is still quite young, and should be considered 'alpha'. We welcome your suggestions
and improvements! Here's how you install it:

	upload this package to a webserver where you have root access, and browse to it.

If you don't have a server, read 'HELP-GETTING-A-SERVER' in this directory.
If you have a server, but don't now how to upload this packages, read 'HELP-UPLOADING-THIS-SDK'
