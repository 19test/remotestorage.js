UNDER TRANSITION
==========

THIS CODE DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK.

when the maintenance window is finished (which it is not if you are reading this), you'll be able to install as follows:

* get a server with apache and php. For instance, you can get debian lenny server at rackspace, ssh to it as root, and run 'apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5'.
* point a domain name (sub-domains are OK) to the server, which will be the domain of your unhosted web app.
* download Unhosted.tar.gz from http://www.unhosted.org/ and put it in the appropriate directory (for instance /var/www) on your server. 
* open the website in your browser.
* follow instructions from there.
