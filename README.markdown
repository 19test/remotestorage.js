==========

THIS CODE DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK.

when the maintenance window is finished (which it is not if you are reading this), you'll be able to install as follows:

* get a clean debian lenny install
* log as root and run:
  * wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/unhosted/raw/master/install.sh
  * sh install.sh
* hit enter on all questions.
* create /var/www/my-unhosted-website/www/unhosted/config.js after config.sample.js in the same directory
* create /var/www/my-unhosted-website/www/unhosted/settings.php after settings.sample.php in the same directory
