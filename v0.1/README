INSTRUCTIONS:
-this assumes you will run both the clientside and serverside on localhost, and that you have a working webserver installed.
-put this dir in your webroot under git/unhosted/v0.1/, for instance /var/www/git/unhosted/v0.1/
-check that 
	http://localhost/git/unhosted/v0.1/cloudside/unhosted.php
 displays:
	ERROR please add a "protocol" key to your POST

-point helloblog.com to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts
-point demo.unhosted.org to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts
-check that 
	http://demo.unhosted.org/git/unhosted/v0.1/cloudside/unhosted.php
 also displays:
	ERROR please add a "protocol" key to your POST
-make sure /tmp is writable for the www-user.
-browse to:
	http://helloblog.com/git/unhosted/v0.1/wappside/genkey/genkey.html
 and generate a key. Cut-and-paste the .js files that are generated, and save them into /var/www/git/unhosted/v0.1/wappside/examples/wappblog/ or the equivalent path.
-make sure you have FireBug open and check that the server doesn't return any errors in response to the POST when you browse to:
	http://helloblog.com/git/unhosted/v0.1/wappside/examples/wappblog/editor.html
 and hit the 'save' button. This should send a SET command from helloblog.com to demo.unhosted.org
-now have your firebug still open, and browse to:
	http://helloblog.com/git/unhosted/v0.1/wappside/examples/wappblog/bootloader.html
-in firebug you should see it post a GET command to demo.unhosted.org, then the js will check the PubSign signature, decrypt the content,  and assign the blog post text to the <div> tag in bootloader.html.
-so far you have run this test on localhost, but obviously you would make us very happy if you blog about Unhosted, and what would be more convincing than "an unhosted blogpost about unhosted". Just make sure that you
	- change the save path in unhosted.php from /tmp to something else, 
	- change the chans list to something only you know, and not the ones that are in the source code,
	- do not (obviously) publish the file "PublishingPassword.js"
-if you have any improvements to make this demo more user-friendly, please contribute! http://groups.google.com/group/unhosted
