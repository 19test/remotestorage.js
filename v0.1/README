INSTRUCTIONS:
-this assumes you will run both the clientside and serverside on localhost, and that you have a working webserver installed.
-put this dir in your webroot under git/unhosted/
-check that 
	http://localhost/git/unhosted/v0.1/serverside/unhosted.php
 displays:
	ERROR please add a "protocol" key to your POST

-point helloblog.com to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts
-point demo.unhosted.org to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts
-check that 
	http://demo.unhosted.org/git/unhosted/v0.1/serverside/unhosted.php
 also displays:
	ERROR please add a "protocol" key to your POST
-create a directory /tmp/unhosted and make it writable for the www-user.
-browse to:
	http://helloblog.com/git/unhosted/v0.1/clientside/editor.html (TODO: really generate the PubSign inside JS)
 and check that a file containing the text 'DEADBEEF' is created inside /tmp/unhosted
-now have your firebug open, and browse to:
	http://helloblog.com/git/unhosted/v0.1/clientside/bootloader.html
-in firebug you should see it load bootloader.html and unhosted.js on client side, then make an OPTIONS call, and then POST something like:
	cmd	{"method":"GET","key":"helloblog.com+MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCVZl_hiNbNsypM6ktlgJl_jCrE4kl1abMmmXQhenAAFd0ISCW5UACgGwMg74fHe0OcbZQWJ5L2-YPwn7wbhmuyFUMdWFQ23LE08sYYSEqggp6n6MQLgfattzWipDGZ3x2CNyh8RwiH5-rq10Biam-AGj4LXQ7z6CaVB3gXIaJhNQIDAQAB@demo.unhosted.org/myFirstUnhostedBlogPost"}
	protocol	UJ/0.1
 to http://demo.unhosted.org/git/unhosted/v0.1/serverside/unhosted.php
 and assign the test string 'DEADBEEF' to the <div> tag in bootloader.html (TODO: make this the actual base64-ed encrypted version of some real text, and decode it in JS).
